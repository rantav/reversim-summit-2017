    <h4>What Language?</h4>
    <p>
      C.<br />Just kidding.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The default language is Hebrew. This is not an international event, it's a local event for
      local developers. There are awesome developers here in Israel and fine level of content, we’re
      local-patriots ;).
    </p>
    <p>
      Having said that, if you as a speaker would prefer to speak in English that's fine.<br />
      Non-Hebrew speakers are most welcome, but bear in mind that most of the contents is going to
      be in Hebrew.
    </p>
    <h4>Submitters’ perks</h4>
    <p>
      Registration will open about a month before the event. If you've registered on time, all is
      well. If not, <b>every submitter gets a single personal ticket</b>, regardless of whether your
      session got accepted or not (assuming quality submission).{' '}
      <b>Accepted speakers get a personal ticket +1</b> (so you can do a friend a favor)
    </p>
    <h4>How many proposals may I submit?</h4>
    <p>
      You may submit up to 3 proposals in total (e.g. for example two full sessions and one ignite).
    </p>
    <h4>Who can be a speaker?</h4>
    <p>
      We encourage anyone and everyone to consider submitting a session. You should be able to speak
      in front of a large audience and you should have an interesting story to tell, based on your
      professional experience.
